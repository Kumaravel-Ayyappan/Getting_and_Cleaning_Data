The details of the data as well as the modifications made to the data are as described below>

## Introduction To The Data
The data consists of acceleration and velocity data obtained from Samsung Galaxy S II smart watches from 30 separate volunteers when they engage in various activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING). The data from the participants is then randomly split into two groups, train and test, by a proportion of 70% and 30% respectively.
The TRAIN dataset consists of 3 files: `subject_train.txt, X_train.txt, y_train.txt`.
The TEST dataset also consists of 3 similar files: `subject_test.txt, X_test.txt, y_test.txt`.
The subject files contain values of the the subject, the X files contain the results of the experiments, and y files contain the activity labels.

## Variables In New Data
    "Subject" - Numbers representing each participant.
    "Activity" - The activity the participant was engaing in .
